            Hello everyone.<br>
            My name is Gage, and this is my first semester at BYUI. I am a transfer student from Virginia, and I am very happy to be doing in person classes again.<br>
            Some of my hobbies are rock climbing, playing guitar, and anything having to do with technology.<br>
            I want to be a web developer one day, and I think that BYUI is going to be a great experience to help get me there.
