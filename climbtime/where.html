        <h2 class="title">Deals</h2>
        <div class="text">There are some great sites to find deals and good spots for bouldering outside. If you want to find good gyms, normally itâ€™s as easy as googling gyms near you, but for outdoor spots it can be a bit more difficult. For deals, I recommend checking either REI or BackCountry, as these are sites that are used by many climbers and can often have pretty great prices.</div>
        <h2 class="title">Where to Find Climbs</h2>
        <div class="text">As for climbing spots, the most popular app is Mountain Project. It is the standard and it is free to use. It has an interactive map that will show you what is around you, and normally has pretty good directions on how to find each boulder. It also can be used for top rope, sport, alpine, and trad climbing.</div>
