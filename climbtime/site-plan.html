        What is Bouldering
Bouldering is a form of climbing where the climber doesn’t need to wear a harness. Normally they will have their shoes, some chalk, and a crash pad, and not much else. There is also gym bouldering where you don’t even need to have a crash pad, as the floor is padded enough to protect the climber from any falls. The main differences between rope climbing and bouldering is that bouldering normally doesn’t require as much endurance, but needs more power and technique. Many people will call someone who only boulders a “boulder bro” because normally it is people who care about the muscley moves they get to use when bouldering.
History of Bouldering
Bouldering started in Fontainebleau, France as a way for people to train to climb the Alps in the early 1900s. It wasn’t until about 40 years later that Pierre Allain realized how bouldering was so different from traditional climbing. He developed climbing shoes to help grip the rock better with better quality rubber soles. It also started developing as its own sport around the same time in Yosemite Valley in the United States. In the 1970s they started using crash pads to protect from falls and to be able to climb harder and harder problems. In the 1980s bouldering really blew up in the UK where there are now tons of gyms and crags to explore. Now it is a world wide sport that you can find just about anywhere in the world.

      <h3>Page 2 -  Holds, Equipment, Techniques, Grades</h3>
      <p>
        There are many different aspects of bouldering that you need to be aware of in order to climb as best as you can. These include: Holds, Equipment, and Technique

Holds
There are mainly 4 different types of holds that you will come across when bouldering, which are jugs, crimps, slopers, and pinches.
Jugs are holds that you can easily get a handful of. They are the best for climbers, but because they are so good to hold onto, they normally will mean a large powerful move once you get to higher grades of climbing.
Crimps are holds that you can usually only get some of your fingers onto. These are usually something you will get better at once you’ve trained your finger strength, as some can get as small as being a half pad of your finger tip.
Slopers are holds that you can’t really grab onto at all, and you need to rely on body tension to hold onto with an open hand. Having a strong wrist can also help to get better with slopers.
Pinches are another hold that is tough for beginners, as they rely on your pinching strength to be able to hold your body up. They require more grip and thumb strength.

Equipment
Some of the common types of equipment that you will see in bouldering are chalk and a chalk bag, climbing shoes, and crash pads. Because bouldering is not normally very high (unless you are doing a highball which can be over 20 feet) you don’t need to have a harness or rope to do it. That being said, you still need some fall protection. Most gyms will have padding built into the floor of the bouldering areas, but if you want to go outside you will have to buy your own crash pad. Between the costs of those and climbing shoes which can each be above $200, the sport can get pretty expensive, but you normally don’t have to buy these very often.

Techniques
There are many different techniques involved with climbing in general, but in bouldering it comes out much more often. Some of the different techniques will help quite a bit with getting over a problem that you can’t seem to find a way up. Things like drop knees, where you drop your back knee down to get a better reach to the opposite side, knee bars, where you have your foot and knee wedged between holds to lock yourself into a more stable position, and many more.

Grades
The grading scale in bouldering is different depending on the country, and gym that you’re in but the American standard is the Vermin scale, which grades each bouldering on the V-scale. VB is the very lowest for beginners, then it goes from V0 up to V17. V17 climbs are insanely hard and have only been done by around 8 people in the world. The European standard for bouldering grades is the Fontainebleau scale, named after where bouldering first came from. It starts at a level 3 which is equal to VB and then goes through grades with a number, letter, and plus or minus depending on the challenge. The grades are 3, 4-, 4, 4+, 5, 5+ 6A, 6A+, 6B, 6B+, 6C, 6C+, 7A, 7A+, up in a similar way to 9A which is equal to V17.

      <h3>Page 3 - Deals, Where to find climbs</h3>
      <p>
        There are some great sites to find deals and good spots for bouldering outside. If you want to find good gyms, normally it’s as easy as googling gyms near you, but for outdoor spots it can be a bit more difficult. 

        For deals, I recommend checking either REI or BackCountry, as these are sites that are used by many climbers and can often have pretty great prices. 
        As for climbing spots, the most popular app is Mountain Project. It is the standard and it is free to use. It has an interactive map that will show you what is around you, and normally has pretty good directions on how to find each boulder. It also can be used for top rope, sport, alpine, and trad climbing.
